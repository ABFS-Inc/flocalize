## 🔍 **How the Age-Gender Pyramid Search Logic Works**

### **Traditional Scoring (All Locations)**
```
User: Female, 26-30, Professional, Similar crowds
Venue: Trendy Café in SoHo

Age Score:     26-30 primary for cafés = +1 point
Gender Score:  Female prefers cafés = +2 points  
Lifestyle:     Professional fits cafés = +2 points
Budget Factor: Professional = ×1.2 multiplier
Final Score:   (1 + 2 + 2) × 1.2 = 6.0 points
Match %:       60% demographic match
```

### **Enhanced Manhattan Scoring (Manhattan Only)**
```
Same user + venue, but with REAL-TIME data:

SafeGraph Data:     Current foot traffic shows 65% female, age 25-35
Foursquare Data:    Recent check-ins trend young professional  
Instagram Data:     Hashtags indicate work-from-café culture
Google Reviews:     Language suggests professional crowd
Census Data:        SoHo baseline: affluent, educated demographics

Real-Time Score:    0.85 (85% compatibility)
Traditional Score:  0.60 (60% compatibility)  
Combined Score:     (0.85 × 0.7) + (0.60 × 0.3) = 77.5%
```

### **Key Differences:**
- **Traditional**: Based on venue categories and user preferences
- **Real-Time**: Based on actual current demographics of people at venues
- **Manhattan Enhancement**: Combines both with 70/30 weighting
