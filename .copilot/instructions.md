# Flocalize - Localize where your crowd is flocking to â€“ Development Instructions

## Key Technologies & Environment
- Python 3.12.9 backend, HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
- Conda environment: `flocalize_env`
- Deployment: Windows Server 2022 (AWS EC2 VPS)
- AI/ML: Grok 4 for content creation, Gemini 2.5 Flash for Instagram action decisions


## Coding & Documentation Standards
- Follow PEP 8, use type hints, f-strings, and modular design (see `agent-config.md` for details)
- Frontend: Use semantic HTML5, modern CSS, ES6+ JavaScript
- Chrome Extension: Manifest V3, minimal permissions, secure and efficient
- No docstrings or code comments; code should be self-explanatory
- Update `README.md` for new features


## Development Workflow
- Use PowerShell only for all commands
- Always activate `flocalize_env` before running code
- Use conda for package management (pip only if necessary)
- Use Windows-style paths
- For agent/terminal settings, see `agent-config.md`

## Testing Guidelines
- Write unit and integration tests for all code, always in the same file as the code being tested, right after the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
- Always test with real API calls, real data, never use mock data or mock api or mock anything. 
- All the files generated by tests must be always placed in the `test_outputs` folder.

## Deployment
- Backend: Windows Server 2022 (AWS EC2 VPS)
- Frontend: Serve static files from any web server
- Chrome Extension: Package for Chrome Web Store or private use


## Security & Config
- Never hardcode API keys; rotate keys regularly
- Use HTTPS, encrypt sensitive data, follow privacy regulations
- Store secrets in config files in AppData (see `project-context.md`)
- Use Python logging, Black formatter, pytest


## Troubleshooting
- Check logs for errors, reproduce issues locally, use debugging tools
- See `project-context.md` for logging locations
